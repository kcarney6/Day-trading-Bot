# Day-trading-Bot

This is the code from my Senior Project as a computer science major at Villanova. Funny story about this project: I started it in the fall semester of 2022 and the trading platform that I was going to run it on crashed on November 11, 2022 thanks Sam Bankman Fried. I ended up using Binance.com instead, and completed the project.
