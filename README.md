# Day-trading-Bot

Funny story about this project: I started it in the fall semester of 2022 as my Senior project, and the trading platform that I was going to run it on crashed on November 11, 2022 thanks Sam Bankman Fried. I ended up using Binance.com instead, and completed the project.  

Motivation for this project: 
The biggest threat to a day
trader's own profits is trading
based on emotions. The reason
why "algorithmic trading
accounts for about 60-75 percent
of the overall trading volume" is
that it takes the emotion out of
the equation. The philosophy of
this project is to remove
philosophy. To set up a trading
strategy, and get out of its way


Learned: 
Coding makes it possible to make
money while you sleep. I learned how
to use the Binance API for executing
trades, monitoring real-time prices,
and querying historical data for
backtesting. Learned how to set up an
AWS EC2 instance, and why it is
important to do so. In the
background, the fall of FTX, which
happened in the middle of my
project, taught me how dangerous
crypto trading can be.
